# eShop

# Main Idea

The main idea is to create an eShop using new technologies, I want to try latest **C#** with all new features, **Microservices**, **Entity Framework**, **Kafka or RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, **Elastic**, **Clickhouse**, **Docker**, Maybe **gRPC**.


## Getting Started

1. Install Docker on your computer. https://www.docker.com/
2. Start Docker
3. In this point you have two ways: <br>
  3.1. Lazy way, lol, just start `startAll.bat` script in root directory, and pray that it works. <br>
  3.2. Hardcore mode for real men, lul, go to the Services and after that go folder by folder and use the instruction in those folders, for example: Service/Catalog... Read README, do step by step... I hope, it will work
4. Launched on the ports:
  4.1. Catalog - 6001


~~P.S. Don't try to find me if your computer burns out after following all the steps in this instruction~~

## Front-end Part

My friend will help me with front-end functionality, because I'm not so good in React / Angular and I don't have big expertise in Front-end. I'll promise, I'll learn React in the future :)

You can see front-end code here: https://github.com/xXxT0P-C0DERS-2013xXx/shop-frontend
